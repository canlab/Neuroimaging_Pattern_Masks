The S1 folder includes SVM weight map
(MNI space, 2-mm resolution)and its intercept.

This weight map was calculated using paired-SVM method which highlights
individual difference in the PRE and POST-maneuver data. To apply the weight, the data need to be
prepared into two forms: POST-PRE set and PRE-POST set. then apply
classification for 'POST-PRE (e.g., positive class)' vs 'PRE-POST
(negative)' (i.e., paired-SVM).
