   abstract = {In addition to their well-established role in signaling rewarding outcomes and reward-predictive cues and in mediating positive reinforcement, there is growing evidence that nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons also signal aversive events and cues that predict them. Here we use diffusion tractography to subdivide the right NAc into lateral-rostral (putative core, pcore) and medial-caudal (putative shell, pshell) subdivisions in humans. The two subregions exhibited differential structural connectivity, based on probabilistic tractography, to prefrontal cortical and subcortical limbic regions. We also demonstrate unique roles for each of the two subdivisions for monetary reward and thermal pain perception tasks: pshell signaling impending pain and value predictions for monetary gambles and pcore activating with anticipation of cessation of thermal pain (signaling reward value of analgesia). We examined functional connectivity for resting state, monetary reward, and thermal pain tasks, and for all three conditions observed that pcore and pshell of right NAc exhibit distinct patterns of synchrony (functional connectivity) to prefrontal cortical and subcortical limbic targets within the right hemisphere. To validate the NAc segregation, we mirrored the coordinates of right NAc pcore and pshell onto the left hemisphere and examined structural and resting state connectivity in the left hemisphere. This latter analysis closely replicated target-specific connections we obtained for the right hemisphere. Overall, we demonstrate that the human NAc can be parceled based on structural and functional connectivity, and that activity in these subdivisions differentially encodes values for expected pain relief and for expected monetary reward.},

   abstract = {Decades of animal and human neuroimaging research have identified distinct, but overlapping, striatal zones, which are interconnected with separable corticostriatal circuits, and are crucial for the organization of functional systems. Despite continuous efforts to subdivide the human striatum based on anatomical and resting-state functional connectivity, characterizing the different psychological processes related to each zone remains a work in progress. Using an unbiased, data-driven approach, we analyzed large-scale coactivation data from 5,809 human imaging studies. We (i) identified five distinct striatal zones that exhibited discrete patterns of coactivation with cortical brain regions across distinct psychological processes and (ii) identified the different psychological processes associated with each zone. We found that the reported pattern of cortical activation reliably predicted which striatal zone was most strongly activated. Critically, activation in each functional zone could be associated with distinct psychological processes directly, rather than inferred indirectly from psychological functions attributed to associated cortices. Consistent with well-established findings, we found an association of the ventral striatum (VS) with reward processing. Confirming less well-established findings, the VS and adjacent anterior caudate were associated with evaluating the value of rewards and actions, respectively. Furthermore, our results confirmed a sometimes overlooked specialization of the posterior caudate nucleus for executive functions, often considered the exclusive domain of frontoparietal cortical circuits. Our findings provide a precise functional map of regional specialization within the human striatum, both in terms of the differential cortical regions and psychological functions associated with each striatal zone.},

   abstract = {Understanding the amazingly complex human cerebral cortex requires a map (or parcellation) of its major subdivisions, known as cortical areas. Making an accurate areal map has been a century-old objective in neuroscience. Using multi-modal magnetic resonance images from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and an objective semi-automated neuroanatomical approach, we delineated 180 areas per hemisphere bounded by sharp changes in cortical architecture, function, connectivity, and/or topography in a precisely aligned group average of 210 healthy young adults. We characterized 97 new areas and 83 areas previously reported using post-mortem microscopy or other specialized study-specific approaches. To enable automated delineation and identification of these areas in new HCP subjects and in future studies, we trained a machine-learning classifier to recognize the multi-modal 'fingerprint' of each cortical area. This classifier detected the presence of 96.6% of the cortical areas in new subjects, replicated the group parcellation, and could correctly locate areas in individuals with atypical parcellations. The freely available parcellation and classifier will enable substantially improved neuroanatomical precision for studies of the structural and functional organization of human cerebral cortex and its variation across individuals and in development, aging, and disease.},

Despite the widespread use of cortical folding patterns to perform ad hoc estimations of the locations of the BAs, little is understood regarding 1) how variable the position of a given BA is with respect to the folds, 2) whether the location of some BAs is more variable than others, and 3) whether the variability is related to the level of a BA in a putative cortical hierarchy. We use whole-brain histology of 10 postmortem human brains and surface-based analysis to test how well the folds predict the locations of the BAs. We show that higher order cortical areas exhibit more variability than primary and secondary areas and that the folds are much better predictors of the BAs than had been previously thought. These results further highlight the significance of cortical folding patterns and suggest a common mechanism for the development of the folds and the cytoarchitectonic fields. © 2007 The Authors.},

Many current human brain atlases cover only specific structures, lack fine-grained parcellations, and fail to provide functionally important connectivity information. Using noninvasive multimodal neuroimaging techniques, we designed a connectivity-based parcellation framework that identifies the subdivisions of the entire human brain, revealing the in vivo connectivity architecture. The resulting human Brainnetome Atlas, with 210 cortical and 36 subcortical subregions, provides a fine-grained, cross-validated atlas and contains information on both anatomical and functional connections. Additionally, we further mapped the delineated structures to mental processes by reference to the BrainMap database. It thus provides an objective and stable starting point from which to explore the complex relationships between structure, connectivity, and function, and eventually improves understanding of how the human brain works. The human Brainnetome Atlas will be made freely available for download at http://atlas.brainnetome.org, so that whole brain parcellations, connections, and functional data will be readily available for researchers to use in their investigations into healthy and pathological states.},

We unveil four scales of subcortical organization that recapitulate well-known anatomical nuclei at the coarsest scale and delineate 27 new bilateral regions at the finest. Ultrahigh field strength fMRI corroborates and extends this organizational structure, enabling the delineation of finer subdivisions of the hippocampus and the amygdala, while task-evoked fMRI reveals a subtle subcortical reorganization in response to changing cognitive demands. A new subcortical atlas is delineated, personalized to represent individual differences and used to uncover reproducible brain–behavior relationships. Linking cortical networks to subcortical regions recapitulates a task-positive to task-negative axis.

   abstract = {Probabilistic maps of neocortical areas and subcortical fiber tracts, warped to a common reference brain, have been published using microscopic architectonic parcellations in ten human postmortem brains. The maps have been successfully applied as topographical references for the anatomical localization of activations observed in functional imaging studies. Here, for the first time, we present stereotaxic, probabilistic maps of the hippocampus, the amygdala and the entorhinal cortex and some of their subdivisions. Cytoarchitectonic mapping was performed in serial, cell-body stained histological sections. The positions and the extent of cytoarchitectonically defined structures were traced in digitized histological sections, 3-D reconstructed and warped to the reference space of the MNI single subject brain using both linear and non-linear elastic tools of alignment. The probability maps and volumes of all structures were calculated. The precise localization of the borders of the mapped regions cannot be predicted consistently by macroanatomical landmarks. Many borders, e.g. between the subiculum and entorhinal cortex, subiculum and Cornu ammonis, and amygdala and hippocampus, do not match sulcal landmarks such as the bottom of a sulcus. Only microscopic observation enables the precise localization of the borders of these brain regions. The superposition of the cytoarchitectonic maps in the common spatial reference system shows a considerably lower degree of intersubject variability in size and position of the allocortical structures and nuclei than the previously delineated neocortical areas. For the first time, the present observations provide cytoarchitectonically verified maps of the human amygdala, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, which take into account the stereotaxic position of the brain structures as well as intersubject variability. We believe that these maps are efficient tools for the precise microstructural localization of fMRI, PET and anatomical MR data, both in healthy and pathologically altered brains.},

   abstract = {Functional neurosurgery relies on robust localization of the subcortical target structures, which cannot be visualized directly with current clinically available in-vivo imaging techniques. Therefore, one has still to rely on an indirect approach, by transferring detailed histological maps onto the patient's individual brain images. In contrast to macroscopic MRI atlases, which often represent the average of a population, each stack of sections, which a stereotactic atlas provides, is based on a single specimen. In addition to this bias, the anatomy is displayed with a highly anisotropic resolution, leading to topological ambiguities and limiting the accuracy of geometric reconstruction. In this work we construct an unbiased, high-resolution three-dimensional atlas of the thalamic structures, representing the average of several stereotactically oriented histological maps. We resolve the topological ambiguity by combining the information provided by histological data from different stereotactic directions. Since the stacks differ not only in geometrical detail provided, but also due to inter-individual variability, we adopt an iterative approach for reconstructing the mean model. Starting with a reconstruction from a single stack of sections, we iteratively register the current reference model onto the available data and reconstruct a refined mean three-dimensional model. The results show that integration of multiple stereotactic anatomical data to produce an unbiased, mean model of the thalamic nuclei and their subdivisions is feasible and that the integration reduces problems of atlas reconstruction inherent to histological stacks to a large extent. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

For the whole-brain parcellation, the available PMs are combined into a maximum probability map (MPM) by considering for each voxel the probability of all cytoarchitectonic brain regions, and determining the most probable assignment. In later versions of this dataset, gap maps complement the maximum probability map of the cytoarchitectonically defined brain regions to achieve full cortical coverage. There are two sets of PMs with a different degree of parcellation included. The set with 157 PMs corresponds to the usual granularity of the Julich-Brain Atlas. This set was used for the calculation of the MPM. Furthermore, a set with 175 PMs is included. This dataset contains, for some regions, more detailed cytoarchitectonic parcellations. For technical reasons, this finer parcellation is only representable via individual PMs due to the spatial resolution of the reference space, i.e., the MPM for the set of 175 PMs is not available. In addition, a set of cortical areas of the MPM is available on the FreeSurfer fsaverage surface.

   abstract = {The nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM) is the major source of cortical acetylcholine (ACh) and has been related to cognitive processes and to neurological disorders. However, spatially delineating the human nbM in MRI studies remains challenging. Due to the absence of a functional localiser for the human nbM, studies to date have localised it using nearby neuroanatomical landmarks or using probabilistic atlases. To understand the feasibility of MRI of the nbM we set our four goals; our first goal was to review current human nbM region-of-interest (ROI) selection protocols used in MRI studies, which we found have reported highly variable nbM volume estimates. Our next goal was to quantify and discuss the limitations of existing atlas-based volumetry of nbM. We found that the identified ROI volume depends heavily on the atlas used and on the probabilistic threshold set. In addition, we found large disparities even for data/studies using the same atlas and threshold. To test whether spatial resolution contributes to volume variability, as our third goal, we developed a novel nbM mask based on the normalized BigBrain dataset. We found that as long as the spatial resolution of the target data was 1.3 mm isotropic or above, our novel nbM mask offered realistic and stable volume estimates. Finally, as our last goal we tried to discern nbM using publicly available and novel high resolution structural MRI ex vivo MRI datasets. We find that, using an optimised 9.4T quantitative T2⁎ ex vivo dataset, the nbM can be visualised using MRI. We conclude caution is needed when applying the current methods of mapping nbM, especially for high resolution MRI data. Direct imaging of the nbM appears feasible and would eliminate the problems we identify, although further development is required to allow such imaging using standard (f)MRI scanning.},

Here, we propose a Bayesian model-based functional clustering approach applied solely to resting state striatal functional MRI timecourses to identify intrinsic striatal functional modules. Data from two sets of ten participants were used to obtain parcellations and examine their robustness. This stable clustering was used to initialize a more constrained model in order to obtain individualized parcellations in 57 additional participants. Resulting cluster time courses were used to examine functional connectivity between clusters and related to the rest of the brain in a GLM analysis. We find six distinct clusters in each hemisphere, with clear inter-hemispheric correspondence and functional relevance. These clusters exhibit functional connectivity profiles that further underscore their homologous nature and are consistent with existing notions on segregation and integration in parallel cortico-basal ganglia loops. Our findings suggest that multiple territories within both the affective and motor regions can be distinguished solely using resting state functional MRI from these regions.},

   abstract = {The thalamic nuclei are involved in many neurodegenerative diseases and therefore, their identification is of key importance in numerous clinical treatments. Automated segmentation of thalamic subparts is currently achieved by exploring diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI), but in absence of such data, atlas-based segmentation can be used as an alternative. Currently, there is a limited number of available digital atlases of the thalamus. Moreover, all atlases are created using a few subjects only, thus are prone to errors due to the inter-subject variability of the thalamic morphology. In this work, we present a probabilistic atlas of anatomical subparts of the thalamus built upon a relatively large dataset where the individual thalamic parcellation was done by employing a recently proposed automatic diffusion-based clustering method. Our analyses, comparing the segmentation performance between the atlas-based and the clustering method, demonstrate the ability of the provided atlas to substitute the automated diffusion-based subdivision in the individual space when the DW-MRI is not available.},

   abstract = {The human thalamus is a brain structure that comprises numerous, highly specific nuclei. Since these nuclei are known to have different functions and to be connected to different areas of the cerebral cortex, it is of great interest for the neuroimaging community to study their volume, shape and connectivity in vivo with MRI. In this study, we present a probabilistic atlas of the thalamic nuclei built using ex vivo brain MRI scans and histological data, as well as the application of the atlas to in vivo MRI segmentation. The atlas was built using manual delineation of 26 thalamic nuclei on the serial histology of 12 whole thalami from six autopsy samples, combined with manual segmentations of the whole thalamus and surrounding structures (caudate, putamen, hippocampus, etc.) made on in vivo brain MR data from 39 subjects. The 3D structure of the histological data and corresponding manual segmentations was recovered using the ex vivo MRI as reference frame, and stacks of blockface photographs acquired during the sectioning as intermediate target. The atlas, which was encoded as an adaptive tetrahedral mesh, shows a good agreement with previous histological studies of the thalamus in terms of volumes of representative nuclei. When applied to segmentation of in vivo scans using Bayesian inference, the atlas shows excellent test-retest reliability, robustness to changes in input MRI contrast, and ability to detect differential thalamic effects in subjects with Alzheimer's disease. The probabilistic atlas and companion segmentation tool are publicly available as part of the neuroimaging package FreeSurfer.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neurosurgical interventions of the thalamus rely on transferring stereotactic coordinates from an atlas onto the patient's MR brain images. We propose a prototype application for performing thalamus target map individualization by fusing patient-specific thalamus geometric information and diffusion tensor tractography. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Previously, our workgroup developed a thalamus atlas by fusing anatomic information from 7 histologically processed thalami. Thalamocortical connectivity maps were generated from DTI scans of 40 subjects by using a previously described procedure and were mapped to a standard neuroimaging space. These data were merged into a statistical shape model describing the morphologic variability of the thalamic outline, nuclei, and connectivity landmarks. This model was used to deform the atlas to individual images. Postmortem MR imaging scans were used to quantify the accuracy of nuclei predictions. RESULTS: Reliable tractography-based markers were located in the ventral lateral thalamus, with the somatosensory connections coinciding with the VPLa and VPLp nuclei; and motor/premotor connections, with the VLpv and VLa nuclei. Prediction accuracy of thalamus outlines was higher with the SSM approach than the ACPC alignment of data (0.56 mm versus 1.24; Dice overlap: 0.87 versus 0.7); for individual nuclei: 0.65 mm, Dice: 0.63 (SSM); 1.24 mm, Dice: 0.4 (ACPC). CONCLUSIONS: Previous studies have already applied DTI to the thalamus. As a further step in this direction, we demonstrate a hybrid approach by using statistical shape models, which have the potential to cope with intersubject variations in individual thalamus geometry.},

At the same time, these developments have led to an increasing need for a high-resolution probabilistic in vivo anatomical atlas of subcortical nuclei. In order to address this need, we constructed high spatial resolution, three-dimensional templates, using high-accuracy diffeomorphic registration of T"1-and T"2-weighted structural images from 168 typical adults between 22 and 35 years old. In these templates, many tissue boundaries are clearly visible, which would otherwise be impossible to delineate in data from individual studies. The resulting delineations of subcortical nuclei complement current histology-based atlases. We further created a companion library of software tools for atlas development, to offer an open and evolving resource for the creation of a crowd-sourced in vivo probabilistic anatomical atlas of the human brain.},

   abstract = {Previous neuroimaging studies have shown brain activity during not only the application of noxious stimuli, but also prior to stimulation. The functional significance of the anticipatory response, however, has yet to be explored. Two theoretical responses involve either a decrease or an increase in sensitivity of the nociceptive system. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, brainstem responses during anticipation and processing of thermal noxious stimuli were investigated. Twelve healthy subjects were warned prior to and then received noxious stimulation to their left hand. Behavioral data showed a positive correlation between the intensity of anticipation and pain. FMRI data revealed brainstem activation in the PAG during the anticipation period. When correlated with individual anticipation ratings, activation during anticipation included significant clusters within the entorhinal cortex and ventral tegmental area (VTA). During receipt, activation within the brainstem included the PAG, VTA, rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), and the parabrachial nucleus (PB), all elements of descending pain pathways. Using a backward model approach, we explored the functional significance of the anticipatory neural response for subsequent pain processing. Results of this regression analysis revealed that insula activity during receipt was predicted by activity in both the entorhinal cortex and VTA during anticipation. We suggest that activation in both regions before and during pain may underlie anticipation and subsequent pain modulatory responses, possibly involving the appraisal and control of attention necessary for pain modulation. Together, the results suggest a possible role of brainstem areas in anticipatory mechanisms involved in the maintenance of chronic pain. © 2006 International Association for the Study of Pain.},

It is remarkably difficult to precisely extrapolate the location of these nuclei from ex vivo atlases to conventional 3 Tesla in vivo images; thus, a probabilistic brainstem template in stereotaxic neuroimaging space in living humans is needed. We delineated these nuclei using single-subject high contrast 1.1 mm isotropic resolution 7 Tesla MRI images. After precise coregistration of nuclei labels to stereotaxic space, we generated a probabilistic template of their anatomical locations. Finally, we validated the nuclei labels in the template by assessing their inter-rater agreement, consistency across subjects and volumes. We also performed a preliminary comparison of their location and microstructural properties to histologic sections of a postmortem human brainstem specimen. In future, the resulting probabilistic template of these brainstem nuclei in stereotaxic space may assist researchers and clinicians in evaluating autonomic, vestibular and VSM nuclei structure, function and connectivity in living humans using conventional 3 Tesla MRI scanners.},

Yet, these nuclei are difficult to identify with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of living humans. In the current work, we developed a probabilistic atlas of these brainstem nuclei in living humans, using noninvasive ultra-high-field MRI. Methods: We acquired single-subject, multicontrast (diffusion and T2-weighted), 1.1-mm isotropic resolution, 7 Tesla MRI images of 12 healthy subjects. After preprocessing and alignment to the stereotactic space, these images were used to delineate (in each subject) the nuclei of interest based on the image contrast as well as on neighboring nuclei and landmarks. Nucleus labels were averaged across subjects to yield probabilistic labels. The latter were further validated by assessment of the label inter-rater agreement, internal consistency, and volume. Results: Labels were delineated for each nucleus with good overlap across subjects. The inter-rater agreement and internal consistency were below (p < 10-8) the linear spatial imaging resolution (1.1 mm), thus validating the generated probabilistic atlas labels. The volumes of our labels did not differ from literature volumes (p < 0.05), further validating our atlas. Discussion and Conclusion: The probabilistic atlas of these five mesopontine nuclei expands current in vivo brainstem nuclei atlases and can be used as a tool to identify the location of these areas in conventional (e.g., 3 Tesla) images. This might serve to unravel the brainstem structure-to-function link and thus improve clinical outcomes.

   abstract = {The locus coeruleus (LC) is a brainstem structure that has widespread cortical and sub-cortical projections to modulate states of attention. Our understanding of the LC's role in both normal attention and clinical populations affected by disrupted attention would be advanced by having in vivo functional and structural markers of the human LC. Evidence for LC activation can be difficult to interpret because of uncertainty about whether brainstem activity can be accurately localized to the LC. High resolution T1-turbo spin echo (T1-TSE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (in-plane resolution of 0.4 mm × 0.4 mm) was used in this study to characterize the location and distribution probability of the LC across 44 adults ranging in age from 19 to 79 years. Utilizing a study-specific brainstem template, the individual brainstems were aligned into standard space, while preserving variations in LC signal intensity. Elevated T1-TSE signal was observed in the rostral pons that was strongly correlated with the position and concentration of LC cells previously reported in a study of post-mortem brains (r = 0.90). The elevated T1-TSE signal was used to produce a probabilistic map of the LC in standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinate space. This map can be used to test hypotheses about the LC in human structural and functional imaging studies. Such efforts will contribute to our understanding of attention systems in normal and clinical populations. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Recent developments in neuroimaging methods and scanning protocols have made it possible to visualize the human LC in vivo by utilizing a T1-weighted turbo spin echo (TSE) scan. Despite its frequent use and its application as a biomarker for tracking the progress of monoaminergic-related neurodegenerative diseases, no study to date has investigated the reproducibility and inter-observer variability of LC identification using this TSE scan sequence. In this paper, we aim to quantify the test–retest reliability of LC imaging by assessing stability of the TSE contrast of the LC across two independent scan sessions and by quantifying the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the TSE scan. Additionally, we created a probabilistic LC atlas which can facilitate the spatial localization of the LC in standardized (MNI) space. Seventeen healthy volunteers participated in two scanning sessions with a mean intersession interval of 2.8 months. We found that for intra-rater reliability the mean Dice coefficient ranged between 0.65 and 0.74, and inter-rater reliability ranged between 0.54 and 0.64, showing moderate reproducibility. The mean LC contrast was 13.9% (SD 3.8) and showed scan–rescan stability (ROI approach: ICC = 0.63; maximum intensity approach: ICC = 0.53). We conclude that localization and segmentation of the LC in vivo are a challenging but reliable enterprise although clinical or longitudinal studies should be carried out carefully.},

   abstract = {The brainstem is a critical structure that regulates vital autonomic functions, houses the cranial nerves and their nuclei, relays motor and sensory information between the brain and spinal cord, and modulates cognition, mood, and emotions. As a primary relay center, the fiber pathways of the brainstem include efferent and afferent connections among the cerebral cortex, spinal cord, and cerebellum. While diffusion MRI has been successfully applied to map various brain pathways, its application for the in vivo imaging of the brainstem pathways has been limited due to inadequate resolution and large susceptibility-induced distortion artifacts. With the release of high-resolution data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), there is increasing interest in mapping human brainstem pathways. Previous works relying on HCP data to study brainstem pathways, however, did not consider the prevalence (>80%) of large distortions in the brainstem even after the application of correction procedures from the HCP-Pipeline. They were also limited in the lack of adequate consideration of subject variability in either fiber pathways or region of interests (ROIs) used for bundle reconstruction. To overcome these limitations, we develop in this work a probabilistic atlas of 23 major brainstem bundles using high-quality HCP data passing rigorous quality control. For the large-scale data from the 500-Subject release of HCP, we conducted extensive quality controls to exclude subjects with severe distortions in the brainstem area. After that, we developed a systematic protocol to manually delineate 1300 ROIs on 20 HCP subjects (10 males; 10 females) for the reconstruction of fiber bundles using tractography techniques. Finally, we leveraged our novel connectome modeling techniques including high order fiber orientation distribution (FOD) reconstruction from multi-shell diffusion imaging and topography-preserving tract filtering algorithms to successfully reconstruct the 23 fiber bundles for each subject, which were then used to calculate the probabilistic atlases in the MNI152 space for public release. In our experimental results, we demonstrate that our method yielded anatomically faithful reconstruction of the brainstem pathways and achieved improved performance in comparison with an existing atlas of cerebellar peduncles based on HCP data. These atlases have been publicly released on NITRIC (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/brainstem_atlas/) and can be readily used by brain imaging researchers interested in studying brainstem pathways.},

Similar evidence in humans is lacking, as neuroimaging studies have mainly focused on cortical changes. To fully characterise the supraspinal contributions to central sensitisation in humans, we used whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T, to record brain responses to punctate mechanical stimulation in an area of secondary hyperalgesia. We used the heat/capsaicin sensitisation model to induce secondary hyperalgesia on the right lower leg in 12 healthy volunteers. A paired t-test was used to compare activation maps obtained during punctate stimulation of the secondary hyperalgesia area and those recorded during control punctate stimulation (same body site, untreated skin, separate session). The following areas showed significantly increased activation (Z>2.3, corrected P<0.01) during hyperalgesia: contralateral brainstem, cerebellum, bilateral thalamus, contralateral primary and secondary somatosensory cortices, bilateral posterior insula, anterior and posterior cingulate cortices, right middle frontal gyrus and right parietal association cortex. Brainstem activation was localised to two distinct areas of the midbrain reticular formation, in regions consistent with the location of nucleus cuneiformis (NCF) and rostral superior colliculi/periaqueductal gray (SC/PAG). The PAG and the NCF are the major sources of input to the RVM, and therefore in an ideal position to modulate its output. These results suggest that structures in the mesencephalic reticular formation, possibly the NCF and PAG, are involved in central sensitisation in humans. © 2005 International Association for the Study of Pain.

However, animal studies indicate that PAG analgesia is mediated largely via caudal brainstem structures, such as the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) and locus coeruleus (LC). To identify their involvement in endogenous analgesia, we used brainstem optimized, whole-brain imaging to record responses to concurrent thermal stimulation (left forearm) and visual attention tasks of titrated difficulty in 20 healthy subjects. The PAG, LC, and RVM were anatomically discriminated using a probabilistic atlas. Pain ratings disclosed the anticipated analgesic interaction between task difficulty and pain intensity (p < 0.001). Main effects of noxious thermal stimulation were observed across several brain regions, including operculoinsular, primary somatosensory, and cingulate cortices, whereas hard task difficulty was represented in anterior insular, parietal, and prefrontal cortices. Permutation testing within the brainstem nuclei revealed the following: main effects of task in dorsal PAG and right LC; and main effect of temperature in RVM and a task × temperature interaction in right LC. Intrasubject regression revealed a distributed network of supratentorial brain regions and the RVM whose activity was linearly related to pain intensity. Intersubject analgesia scores correlated to activity within a distinct region of the RVM alone. These results identify distinct roles for a brainstem triumvirate in attentional analgesia: with the PAG activated by attentional load; specificRVMregions showing pronociceptive and antinociceptive processes (in line with previous animal studies); and the LC showing lateralized activity during conflicting attentional demands.},

We used resting state fMRI in 154 healthy participants to elucidate patterns of functional connectivity and network organization between cortical/subcortical regions and midbrain/brainstem nuclei.By means of univariate functional connectivity and graph-based analysis, we show that dopaminergic midbrain centers and the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) are functionally integrated with the default mode network (DMN), whereas the remaining serotonergic raphe nuclei and the noradrenergic locus coeruleus are functionally integrated with the executive-control network (ECN). The majority of midbrain/brainstem nuclei show a high level of connectedness to other network modules classifying these nuclei as "connector" hubs. The additionally applied probabilistic independent component analysis (PICA) broadly corresponded with the results of the GT analysis, describing similar functionally-relevant cortical networks.

   abstract = {Mesopontine tegmental nuclei such as the cuneiform, pedunculotegmental, oral pontine reticular, paramedian raphe and caudal linear raphe nuclei, are deep brain structures involved in arousal and motor function. Dysfunction of these nuclei is implicated in the pathogenesis of disorders of consciousness and sleep, as well as in neurodegenerative diseases. However, their localization in conventional neuroimages of living humans is difficult due to limited image sensitivity and contrast, and a stereotaxic probabilistic neuroimaging template of these nuclei in humans does not exist. We used semi-automatic segmentation of single-subject 1.1 mm-isotropic 7 T diffusion-fractional-anisotropy and T2-weighted images in healthy adults to generate an in vivo probabilistic neuroimaging structural template of these nuclei in standard stereotaxic (Montreal Neurological Institute, MNI) space. The template was validated through independent manual delineation, as well as leave-one-out validation and evaluation of nuclei volumes. This template can enable localization of five mesopontine tegmental nuclei in conventional images (e.g. 1.5 T, 3 T) in future studies of arousal and motor physiology (e.g. sleep, anesthesia, locomotion) and pathology (e.g. disorders of consciousness, sleep disorders, Parkinson's disease). The 7 T magnetic resonance imaging procedure for single-subject delineation of these nuclei may also prove useful for future 7 T studies of arousal and motor mechanisms.},

   abstract = {Brainstem nuclei (Bn) in humans play a crucial role in vital functions, such as arousal, autonomic homeostasis, sensory and motor relay, nociception, sleep, and cranial nerve function, and they have been implicated in a vast array of brain pathologies. However, an in vivo delineation of most human Bn has been elusive because of limited sensitivity and contrast for detecting these small regions using standard neuroimaging methods. To precisely identify several human Bn in vivo, we employed a 7 Tesla scanner equipped with multi-channel receive-coil array, which provided high magnetic resonance imaging sensitivity, and a multi-contrast (diffusion fractional anisotropy and T2-weighted) echo-planar-imaging approach, which provided complementary contrasts for Bn anatomy with matched geometric distortions and resolution. Through a combined examination of 1.3 mm3 multi-contrast anatomical images acquired in healthy human adults, we semi-automatically generated in vivo probabilistic Bn labels of the ascending arousal (median and dorsal raphe), autonomic (raphe magnus, periaqueductal gray), and motor (inferior olivary nuclei, two subregions of the substantia nigra compatible with pars compacta and pars reticulata, two subregions of the red nucleus, and, in the diencephalon, two subregions of the subthalamic nucleus) systems. These labels constitute a first step toward the development of an in vivo neuroimaging template of Bn in standard space to facilitate future clinical and research investigations of human brainstem function and pathology. Proof-of-concept clinical use of this template is demonstrated in a minimally conscious patient with traumatic brainstem hemorrhages precisely localized to the raphe Bn involved in arousal.},

Materials and Methods: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Gil Medical Center, and all volunteers provided written informed consent. FDG PET, 11C-DASB PET, and T2*- weighted MR images from seven healthy volunteers were acquired by using a PET/MR imaging fusion system. The standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of FDG (FDG-SUVR) and nondisplaceable binding potential (BPnd) of 11C-DASB (DASB-BPnd) were determined for each raphe nucleus. A Pearson correlation analysis was performed to show the correlation between FDG-SUVR and DASB-BPnd for the raphe nuclei. Results: Each raphe nucleus could be distinguished in both FDG (identifiability ratio, 0.86; κ = 0.77) and 11C-DASB (identifiability ratio, 0.89; κ = 0.72) images. The mean values of DASB-BPnd for each raphe nucleus from dorsal to caudal direction were 6.08 (raphe nucleus 1), 5.93 (raphe nucleus 2), 3.86 (raphe nucleus 3), 3.18 (raphe nucleus 4), and 2.74 (raphe nucleus 5); the mean FDG-SUVR values were 1.00 (raphe nucleus 1), 1.00 (raphe nucleus 2), 0.87 (raphe nucleus 3), 0.94 (raphe nucleus 4), and 0.90 (raphe nucleus 5). FDG-SUVR and DASB-BPnd for the raphe nuclei were significantly correlated (r = 0.506, P = .002). Conclusion: Serotonergic activity, both glucose metabolism and transporter binding potential of raphe nuclei, were measured with a brain-dedicated PET/MR imaging system and showed a significant correlation. © RSNA, 2014.},

How receptor systems are situated within macro-scale neuroanatomy and how they shape emergent function remain poorly understood, and there exists no comprehensive atlas of receptors. Here we collate positron emission tomography data from more than 1,200 healthy individuals to construct a whole-brain three-dimensional normative atlas of 19 receptors and transporters across nine different neurotransmitter systems. We found that receptor profiles align with structural connectivity and mediate function, including neurophysiological oscillatory dynamics and resting-state hemodynamic functional connectivity. Using the Neurosynth cognitive atlas, we uncovered a topographic gradient of overlapping receptor distributions that separates extrinsic and intrinsic psychological processes. Finally, we found both expected and novel associations between receptor distributions and cortical abnormality patterns across 13 disorders. We replicated all findings in an independently collected autoradiography dataset. This work demonstrates how chemoarchitecture shapes brain structure and function, providing a new direction for studying multi-scale brain organization.},

The atlas is created from molecular and structural high-resolution neuroimaging data consisting of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans acquired in a total of 210 healthy individuals. Comparison of the regional PET binding measures with postmortem human brain autoradiography outcomes showed a high correlation for the five 5-HT targets and this enabled us to transform the atlas to represent protein densities (in picomoles per milliliter).Wealso assessed the regional association between protein concentration andmRNAexpression in the human brain by comparing the 5-HT density across the atlas with data from the Allen Human Brain atlas and identified receptor- and transporter-specific associations that show the regional relation between the two measures. Together, these data provide unparalleled insight into the serotonin system of the human brain.},

   abstract = {Central autonomic control nuclei in the brainstem have been difficult to evaluate non-invasively in humans. We applied ultrahigh-field (7 T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and the improved spatial resolution it affords (1.2mm isotropic), to evaluate putative brainstem nuclei that control and/or sense pain-evoked cardiovagal modulation (high-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) instantaneously estimated through a point-process approach). The time-variant HF-HRV signal was used to guide the general linear model analysis of neuroimaging data. Sustained (6min) pain stimulation reduced cardiovagal modulation, with the most prominent reduction evident in the first 2min. Brainstem nuclei associated with pain-evoked HF-HRV reduction were previously implicated in both autonomic regulation and pain processing. Specifically, clusters consistent with the rostral ventromedial medulla, ventral nucleus reticularis (Rt)/nucleus ambiguus (NAmb) and pontine nuclei (Pn) were found when contrasting sustained pain versus rest. Analysis of the initial 2-min period identified Rt/NAmb and Pn, in addition to clusters consistent with the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus/nucleus of the solitary tract and locus coeruleus. Combining high spatial resolution fMRI and high temporal resolution HF-HRV allowed for a non-invasive characterization of brainstem nuclei, suggesting that nociceptive afference induces pain-processing brainstem nuclei to function in concert with known premotor autonomic nuclei in order to affect the cardiovagal response to pain.},

However, it remains unknown whether a similar segregation occurs in humans, and a recent tract tracing study suggests that this segregation may not exist. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to define and compare activity patterns of the trigeminal brainstem nuclear complex during non-noxious and noxious cutaneous and non-noxious and noxious muscle orofacial stimulation in humans. We found that during cutaneous pain, signal intensity increased within the entire rostrocaudal extent of the spinal trigeminal nucleus (SpV), encompassing the ipsilateral oralis (SpVo), interpolaris (SpVi) and caudalis (SpVc) subdivisions. In contrast, muscle pain did not activate SpVi, but instead activated a discrete region of the ipsilateral SpVo and SpVc. Further, muscle noxious stimulation activated a region of the ipsilateral lateral pons in the region of the trigeminal principal sensory nucleus (Vp). Innocuous orofacial stimulation (lip brushing) also evoked a significant increase in signal intensity in the ipsilateral Vp; however, non-noxious muscle stimulation showed no increase in signal in this area. The data reveal that orofacial cutaneous and muscle nociceptive information and innocuous cutaneous stimulation are differentially represented within the trigeminal nuclear complex. It is well established that cutaneous and muscle noxious stimuli evoke different perceptual, behavioural and cardiovascular changes. We speculate that the differential activation evoked by cutaneous and muscle noxious stimuli within the trigeminal sensory complex may contribute to the neural basis for these differences. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Methods: Structural connectivity of 12 iRBD patients and 12 controls was evaluated by probabilistic tractography. Two-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the structural connectivity indices across groups. Results: In iRBD, we found impaired (Z = 2.6, P < 0.01) structural connectivity in 14 brainstem nuclei, including the connectivity between REM-on (eg, subcoeruleus [SubC]) and REM sleep muscle atonia (eg, medullary reticular formation) areas.

Postmortem high-resolution MRI circumvents the challenges associated with both modalities. A single human brainstem specimen extending from the rostral diencephalon through the caudal medulla was prepared for imaging after the brain was removed from a 65-year-old male within 24 h of death. The specimen was formalin-fixed for two weeks, then rehydrated and placed in a custom-made MRI compatible tube and immersed in liquid fluorocarbon. MRI was performed in a 7-Tesla scanner with 120 unique diffusion directions. Acquisition time for anatomic and diffusion images were 14 h and 208 h, respectively. Segmentation was performed manually. Deterministic fiber tractography was done using strategically chosen regions of interest and avoidance, with manual editing using expert knowledge of human neuroanatomy. Anatomic and diffusion images were rendered with isotropic resolutions of 50 μm and 200 μm, respectively. Ninety different structures were segmented and labeled, and 11 different fiber bundles were rendered with tractography. The complete atlas is available online for interactive use at https://civmvoxport.vm.duke.edu/voxbase/login.php?return_url=%2Fvoxbase%2F.

To achieve this, we used the increased contrast-to-noise ratio of 7-Tesla fMRI compared with 3 Tesla and time-efficient simultaneous multi-slice imaging to cover the brain with high spatial resolution (1.1-mm isotropic nominal resolution) while maintaining a short repetition time (2.5 s). Results: The delineated Pearson’s correlation-based functional connectivity diagrams (connectomes) of 11 brainstem nuclei of the ascending arousal, motor, and autonomic systems from 12 controls are presented and discussed in the context of existing histology and animal work.

   abstract = {Rationale: Serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission is intimately linked to anxiety and depression and a diverse body of evidence supports the involvement of the main inhibitory serotonergic receptor, the serotonin-1A (5-HT 1A) subtype, in both disorders. Objectives: In this review, we examine the function of 5-HT1A receptor subpopulations and re-interpret our understanding of their role in mental illness in light of new data, separating both spatial (autoreceptor versus heteroreceptor) and the temporal (developmental versus adult) roles of the endogenous 5-HT1A receptors, emphasizing their distinct actions in mediating anxiety and depression-like behaviors. Results: It is difficult to unambiguously distinguish the effects of different populations of the 5-HT1A receptors with traditional genetic animal models and pharmacological approaches. However, with the advent of novel genetic systems and subpopulation-selective pharmacological agents, direct evidence for the distinct roles of these populations in governing emotion-related behavior is emerging. Conclusions: There is strong and growing evidence for a functional dissociation between auto- and heteroreceptor populations in mediating anxiety and depressive-like behaviors, respectively. Furthermore, while it is well established that 5-HT1A receptors act developmentally to establish normal anxiety-like behaviors, the developmental role of 5-HT1A heteroreceptors is less clear, and the specific mechanisms underlying the developmental role of each subpopulation are likely to be key elements determining mood control in adult subjects. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

   abstract = {Early and profound pathological changes are evident in the locus coeruleus (LC) in dementia and Parkinson's disease, with effects on arousal, attention, cognitive and motor control. The LC can be identified in vivo using non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging techniques which have potential as biomarkers for detecting and monitoring disease progression. Technical limitations of existing imaging protocols have impaired the sensitivity to regional contrast variance or the spatial variability on the rostrocaudal extent of the LC, with spatial mapping consistent with post mortem findings. The current study employs a sensitive magnetisation transfer sequence using ultrahigh field 7T MRI to investigate the LC structure in vivo at high-resolution (0.4 × 0.4 × 0.5 mm). Magnetisation transfer images from 53 healthy older volunteers (52 - 84 years) clearly revealed the spatial features of the LC and were used to create a probabilistic LC atlas for older adults. This atlas may be especially relevant for studying disorders associated with older age. To use the atlas does not require use of the same MT sequence of 7T MRI, provided good co-registration and normalisation is achieved. Consistent rostrocaudal gradients of slice-wise volume, contrast and variance along the LC were observed, mirroring distinctive ex vivo spatial distributions of LC cells in its subregions. The contrast-to-noise ratios were calculated for the peak voxels, and for the averaged signals within the atlas, to accommodate the volumetric differences in estimated contrast. The probabilistic atlas is freely available, and the MRI dataset will be made available for non-commercial research, for replication or to facilitate accurate LC localisation and unbiased contrast extraction in future studies.},

   abstract = {The surface of the human cerebellar cortex is much more tightly folded than the cerebral cortex. It was computationally reconstructed for the first time to the level of all individual folia from multicontrast high-resolution postmortem MRI scans. Its total shrinkage-corrected surface area (1,590 cm 2) was larger than expected or previously reported, equal to 78% of the total surface area of the human neocortex. The unfolded and flattened surface comprised a narrow strip 10 cm wide but almost 1 m long. By applying the same methods to the neocortex and cerebellum of the macaque monkey, we found that its cerebellum was relatively much smaller, approximately 33% of the total surface area of its neocortex. This suggests a prominent role for the cerebellum in the evolution of distinctively human behaviors and cognition. cerebellum | surface area | computational | unfolding | evolution D uring human evolution, the cerebellum has expanded in parallel with the neocortex, especially in regions connected to frontal and parietal association areas (1, 2). Indeed, the changes in the cerebellum in terms of volume and neuron number have outstripped increases in the neocortex (3, 4). These evolutionary insights along with neuropsychological investigations have led to a reevaluation of the role of the cerebellum in human cognition (5-7). Like the neocortex, the human cerebellum is a thin sheet of neuronal tissue intricately folded to reduce its overall volume while maintaining its two-dimensional (2D) topology. However, unlike the human neocortex, the surface of the human cerebel-lum has never been computationally reconstructed to the level of all individual small folds (folia). The cerebellar cortex is even thinner than the cerebral cortex and has predominantly medi-olaterally oriented folds that pack its large anterior-posterior extent into a very compact volume. This anisotropy is due to the structural scaffold of parallel fibers that run in a mediolateral direction, perpendicularly intersecting the anteroposteriorly (sagittally) oriented sheet-like dendritic trees of Purkinje cells. Approximately 10 to 15 Purkinje cells arranged in a sagittal microzone receive the same climbing fiber input and form a basic unit of cerebellar computation (8). The mediolateral extent of the folia has expanded somewhat in evolution; however, perhaps due to limits on the length of parallel fibers, the expansion in the anteroposterior direction has been much greater-in humans, almost two orders of magnitude greater. This picture contrasts with the more nearly isotropic expansion of the human neocortex. Our interest in creating an accurate folia-level surface reconstruction was particularly driven by the results of finely detailed (60+ sites/mm 2) microelectrode mapping of the granule cell layer in somatosensory input regions in the cerebellum (9, 10), which revealed a unique "fractured somatotopy" in which tiny, internally somatotopic 2D patches of the body surface were arranged into a mosaic that routinely juxtaposes distant body parts to a much greater degree than is the case in primary so-matosensory cortex. These intricately "fractured" maps were also detected in the Purkinje cell layer using localized naturalistic stimulation of the skin (11), likely the result of the higher syn-aptic density per Purkinje cell of the ascending limb of a parallel fiber compared with the more obvious mediolateral parallel fiber itself. During active movements involving multiple body parts and skin contact points, parallel fibers that extend across multiple patches can integrate information from many distant body parts to speed, refine, and coordinate complex actions. Future studies of the spatial arrangement of these fractured functional maps on the cerebellar surface, and their implications for the computational role of the cerebellum, including possible analogs in the "cognitive cerebellum," will first require a detailed quantitative representation of the complexly folded surface of the human cerebellum. Results We set out to reconstruct, unfold, and flatten the entire human cerebellar surface down to the level of individual folia to quantitatively measure its total surface area, better characterize its Significance The cerebellum has long been recognized as a partner of the cerebral cortex, and both have expanded greatly in human evolution. The thin cerebellar cortex is even more tightly folded than the cerebral cortex. By scanning a human cere-bellum specimen at ultra-high magnetic fields, we were able to computationally reconstruct its surface down to the level of the smallest folds, revealing that the cerebellar cortex has almost 80% of the surface area of the cerebral cortex. By performing the same procedure on a monkey brain, we found that the surface area of the human cerebellum has expanded even more than that of the human cerebral cortex, suggesting a role in characteristically human behaviors, such as toolmaking and language.

This is because a precise localization of these nuclei is hampered by the limited contrast and sensitivity of conventional neuroimaging methods for deep brain nuclei. In this work, we used 7 Tesla multi-modal (T2-weighted and diffusion fractional anisotropy) 1.1 mm isotropic resolution MRI to achieve high sensitivity and contrast for single-subject brainstem and thalamic nuclei delineation. After precise coregistration to stereotactic space, we generated an in vivo human probabilistic atlas of auditory (medial geniculate nucleus, inferior colliculus, and superior olivary complex) and visual (lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus) subcortical nuclei. We foresee the use of this atlas as a tool to precisely identify the location and shape of auditory/visual deep nuclei in research as well as clinical human studies.},

   abstract = {Recent theoretical advances have motivated the hypothesis that the periaqueductal gray (PAG) participates in behaviors that involve changes in the autonomic control of visceromotor activity, including during cognitively demanding tasks. We used ultra-high-field (7 tesla) fMRI to measure human brain activity at 1.1 mm resolution while participants completed a working memory task. Consistent with prior work, participants were less accurate and responded more slowly with increasing memory load—signs of increasing task difficulty. Whole-brain fMRI analysis revealed increased activity in multiple cortical areas with increasing working memory load, including frontal and parietal cortex, dorsal cingulate, supplementary motor area, and anterior insula. Several dopamine-rich midbrain nuclei, such as the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area, also exhibited load-dependent increases in activation. To investigate PAG involvement during cognitive engagement, we developed an automated method for segmenting and spatially normalizing the PAG. Analyses using cross-validated linear support vector machines showed that the PAG discriminated high versus low working memory load conditions with 95% accuracy in individual subjects based on activity increases in lateral and ventrolateral PAG. Effect sizes in the PAG were comparable in magnitude to those in many of the cortical areas. These findings suggest that cognitive control is not only associated with cortical activity in the frontal and parietal lobes, but also with increased activity in the subcortical PAG and other midbrain regions involved in the regulation of autonomic nervous system function.},

   abstract = {The nuclei of the human amygdala remain difficult to distinguish in individual subject structural magnetic resonance images. However, interpretation of the amygdala's role in whole brain networks requires accurate localization of functional activity to a particular nucleus or subgroup of nuclei. To address this, high spatial resolution, three-dimensional templates, using joint high accuracy diffeomorphic registration of T1- and T2-weighted structural images from 168 typical adults between 22 and 35 years old released by the Human Connectome Project were constructed. Several internuclear boundaries are clearly visible in these templates, which would otherwise be impossible to delineate in individual subject data. A probabilistic atlas of major nuclei and nuclear groups was constructed in this template space and mapped back to individual spaces by inversion of the individual diffeomorphisms. Group level analyses revealed a slight (∼2%) bias toward larger total amygdala and nuclear volumes in the right hemisphere. No substantial sex or age differences were found in amygdala volumes normalized to total intracranial volume, or subdivision volumes normalized to amygdala volume. The current delineation provides a finer parcellation of the amygdala with more accurate external boundary definition than current histology-based atlases when used in conjunction with high accuracy registration methods, such as diffeomorphic warping. These templates and delineation are intended to be an open and evolving resource for future functional and structural imaging studies of the human amygdala.

   abstract = {Dysregulation of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is implicated in numerous neuropsychiatric disorders. Treatments targeting this area directly (e.g. deep brain stimulation) demonstrate variable efficacy, perhaps owing to non-specific targeting of a functionally heterogeneous nucleus. Here we provide support for this notion, first observing disparate behavioral effects in response to direct simulation of different locations within the NAc in a human patient. These observations motivate a segmentation of the NAc into subregions, which we produce from a diffusion-tractography based analysis of 245 young, unrelated healthy subjects. We further explore the mechanism of these stimulation-induced behavioral responses by identifying the most probable subset of axons activated using a patient-specific computational model. We validate our diffusion-based segmentation using evidence from several modalities, including MRI-based measures of function and microstructure, human post-mortem immunohistochemical staining, and cross-species comparison of cortical-NAc projections that are known to be conserved. Finally, we visualize the passage of individual axon bundles through one NAc subregion in a post-mortem human sample using CLARITY 3D histology corroborated by 7T tractography. Collectively, these findings extensively characterize human NAc subregions and provide insight into their structural and functional distinctions with implications for stereotactic treatments targeting this region.},

   abstract = {Despite the crucial role of the hypothalamus in the regulation of the human body, neuroimaging studies of this structure and its nuclei are scarce. Such scarcity partially stems from the lack of automated segmentation tools, since manual delineation suffers from scalability and reproducibility issues. Due to the small size of the hypothalamus and the lack of image contrast in its vicinity, automated segmentation is difficult and has been long neglected by widespread neuroimaging packages like FreeSurfer or FSL. Nonetheless, recent advances in deep machine learning are enabling us to tackle difficult segmentation problems with high accuracy. In this paper we present a fully automated tool based on a deep convolutional neural network, for the segmentation of the whole hypothalamus and its subregions from T1-weighted MRI scans. We use aggressive data augmentation in order to make the model robust to T1-weighted MR scans from a wide array of different sources, without any need for preprocessing. We rigorously assess the performance of the presented tool through extensive analyses, including: inter- and intra-rater variability experiments between human observers; comparison of our tool with manual segmentation; comparison with an automated method based on multi-atlas segmentation; assessment of robustness by quality control analysis of a larger, heterogeneous dataset (ADNI); and indirect evaluation with a volumetric study performed on ADNI. The presented model outperforms multi-atlas segmentation scores as well as inter-rater accuracy level, and approaches intra-rater precision. Our method does not require any preprocessing and runs in less than a second on a GPU, and approximately 10 seconds on a CPU. The source code as well as the trained model are publicly available at https://github.com/BBillot/hypothalamus_seg, and will also be distributed with FreeSurfer.},

   abstract = {The human thalamus is a highly connected brain structure, which is key for the control of numerous functions and is involved in several neurological disorders. Recently, neuroimaging studies have increasingly focused on the volume and connectivity of the specific nuclei comprising this structure, rather than looking at the thalamus as a whole. However, accurate identification of cytoarchitectonically designed histological nuclei on standard in vivo structural MRI is hampered by the lack of image contrast that can be used to distinguish nuclei from each other and from surrounding white matter tracts. While diffusion MRI may offer such contrast, it has lower resolution and lacks some boundaries visible in structural imaging. In this work, we present a Bayesian segmentation algorithm for the thalamus. This algorithm combines prior information from a probabilistic atlas with likelihood models for both structural and diffusion MRI, allowing segmentation of 25 thalamic labels per hemisphere informed by both modalities. We present an improved probabilistic atlas, incorporating thalamic nuclei identified from histology and 45 white matter tracts surrounding the thalamus identified in ultra-high gradient strength diffusion imaging. We present a family of likelihood models for diffusion tensor imaging, ensuring compatibility with the vast majority of neuroimaging datasets that include diffusion MRI data. The use of these diffusion likelihood models greatly improves identification of nuclear groups versus segmentation based solely on structural MRI. Dice comparison of 5 manually identifiable groups of nuclei to ground truth segmentations show improvements of up to 10 percentage points. Additionally, our chosen model shows a high degree of reliability, with median test-retest Dice scores above 0.85 for four out of five nuclei groups, whilst also offering improved detection of differential thalamic involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AUROC 81.98%). The probabilistic atlas and segmentation tool will be made publicly available as part of the neuroimaging package FreeSurfer (https://freesurfer.net/fswiki/ThalamicNucleiDTI).},

   abstract = {Background The GPi (globus pallidus internus) is an important target nucleus for Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in medically refractory movement disorders, in particular dystonia and Parkinson's disease. Beneficial clinical outcome critically depends on precise electrode localization. Recent evidence indicates that not only neurons, but also axonal fibre tracts contribute to promoting the clinical effect. Thus, stereotactic planning should, in the future, also take the individual course of fibre tracts into account. Objective The aim of this project is to explore the GPi connectivity profile and provide a connectivity-based parcellation of the GPi. Methods Diffusion MRI sequences were performed in sixteen healthy, right-handed subjects. Connectivity-based parcellation of the GPi was performed applying two independent methods: 1) a hypothesis-driven, seed-to-target approach based on anatomic priors set as connectivity targets and 2) a purely data-driven approach based on k-means clustering of the GPi. Results Applying the hypothesis-driven approach, we obtained five major parcellation clusters, displaying connectivity to the prefrontal cortex, the brainstem, the GPe (globus pallidus externus), the putamen and the thalamus. Parcellation clusters obtained by both methods were similar in their connectivity profile. With the data-driven approach, we obtained three major parcellation clusters. Inter-individual variability was comparable with results obtained in thalamic parcellation. Conclusion The three parcellation clusters obtained by the purely data-driven method might reflect GPi subdivision into a sensorimotor, associative and limbic portion. Clinical and physiological studies indicate greatest clinical DBS benefit for electrodes placed in the postero-ventro-lateral GPi, the region displaying connectivity to the thalamus in our study and generally attributed to the sensorimotor system. Clinical studies relating DBS electrode positions to our GPi connectivity map would be needed to complement our findings.},

Lesions of the ARAS cause coma, the most severe disorder of consciousness. Because of current methodological limitations, including of postmortem tissue analysis, the neuroanatomic connectivity of the human ARAS is poorly understood. We applied the advanced imaging technique of high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) to elucidate the structural connectivity of the ARAS in 3 adult human brains, 2 of which were imaged postmortem. High angular resolution diffusion imaging tractography identified the ARAS connectivity previously described in animals and also revealed novel human pathways connecting the brainstem to the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the basal forebrain. Each pathway contained different distributions of fiber tracts from known neurotransmitter-specific ARAS nuclei in the brainstem. The histologically guided tractography findings reported here provide initial evidence for human-specific pathways of the ARAS. The unique composition of neurotransmitter-specific fiber tracts within each ARAS pathway suggests structural specializations that subserve the different functional characteristics of human arousal. This ARAS connectivity analysis provides proof of principle that HARDI tractography may affect the study of human consciousness and its disorders, including in neuropathologic studies of patients dying in coma and the persistent vegetative state.},

The MRI data acquired by the HCP differ in many ways from data acquired on conventional 3 Tesla scanners and often require newly developed preprocessing methods. We describe the minimal preprocessing pipelines for structural, functional, and diffusion MRI that were developed by the HCP to accomplish many low level tasks, including spatial artifact/distortion removal, surface generation, cross-modal registration, and alignment to standard space. These pipelines are specially designed to capitalize on the high quality data offered by the HCP. The final standard space makes use of a recently introduced CIFTI file format and the associated grayordinate spatial coordinate system. This allows for combined cortical surface and subcortical volume analyses while reducing the storage and processing requirements for high spatial and temporal resolution data. Here, we provide the minimum image acquisition requirements for the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines and additional advice for investigators interested in replicating the HCP's acquisition protocols or using these pipelines. Finally, we discuss some potential future improvements to the pipelines.},

   abstract = {Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) allows one to study functional connectivity in the brain by acquiring fMRI data while subjects lie inactive in the MRI scanner, and taking advantage of the fact that functionally related brain regions spontaneously co-activate. rfMRI is one of the two primary data modalities being acquired for the Human Connectome Project (the other being diffusion MRI). A key objective is to generate a detailed in vivo mapping of functional connectivity in a large cohort of healthy adults (over 1000 subjects), and to make these datasets freely available for use by the neuroimaging community. In each subject we acquire a total of 1. h of whole-brain rfMRI data at 3.

   abstract = {The Human Connectome Project (HCP) relies primarily on three complementary magnetic resonance (MR) methods. These are: 1) resting state functional MR imaging (rfMRI) which uses correlations in the temporal fluctuations in an fMRI time series to deduce '. functional connectivity'; 2) diffusion imaging (dMRI), which provides the input for tractography algorithms used for the reconstruction of the complex axonal fiber architecture; and 3) task based fMRI (tfMRI), which is employed to identify functional parcellation in the human brain in order to assist analyses of data obtained with the first two methods. We describe technical improvements and optimization of these methods as well as instrumental choices that impact speed of acquisition of fMRI and dMRI images at 3. T, leading to whole brain coverage with 2. mm isotropic resolution in 0.7. s for fMRI, and 1.25. mm isotropic resolution dMRI data for tractography analysis with three-fold reduction in total dMRI data acquisition time. Ongoing technical developments and optimization for acquisition of similar data at 7. T magnetic field are also presented, targeting higher spatial resolution, enhanced specificity of functional imaging signals, mitigation of the inhomogeneous radio frequency (RF) fields, and reduced power deposition. Results demonstrate that overall, these approaches represent a significant advance in MR imaging of the human brain to investigate brain function and structure. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Some studies find effects consistent with nociceptive effects, but meta-analyses show that these effects are often small. We analyzed placebo analgesia in a large fMRI study (N = 392), including placebo effects on brain responses to noxious stimuli. Placebo treatment caused robust analgesia in both conditioned thermal and unconditioned mechanical pain. Placebo did not decrease fMRI activity in nociceptive pain regions, including the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS) and pre-registered spinothalamic pathway regions, with strong support from Bayes Factor analyses. However, placebo treatment affected activity in pre-registered analyses of a second neuromarker, the Stimulus Intensity Independent Pain Signature (SIIPS), and several associated a priori brain regions related to motivation and value, in both thermal and mechanical pain. Individual differences in behavioral analgesia were correlated with neural changes in both thermal and mechanical pain. Our results indicate that processes related to affective and cognitive aspects of pain primarily drive placebo analgesia.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

We use functional MRI (fMRI) to map the complex topographic organization of the human subcortex, revealing large-scale connectivity gradients and new areal boundaries. We unveil four scales of subcortical organization that recapitulate well-known anatomical nuclei at the coarsest scale and delineate 27 new bilateral regions at the finest. Ultrahigh field strength fMRI corroborates and extends this organizational structure, enabling the delineation of finer subdivisions of the hippocampus and the amygdala, while task-evoked fMRI reveals a subtle subcortical reorganization in response to changing cognitive demands. A new subcortical atlas is delineated, personalized to represent individual differences and used to uncover reproducible brain–behavior relationships. Linking cortical networks to subcortical regions recapitulates a task-positive to task-negative axis. This new atlas enables holistic connectome mapping and characterization of cortico–subcortical connectivity.},

At the same time, these developments have led to an increasing need for a high-resolution probabilistic in vivo anatomical atlas of subcortical nuclei. In order to address this need, we constructed high spatial resolution, three-dimensional templates, using high-accuracy diffeomorphic registration of T"1-and T"2-weighted structural images from 168 typical adults between 22 and 35 years old. In these templates, many tissue boundaries are clearly visible, which would otherwise be impossible to delineate in data from individual studies. The resulting delineations of subcortical nuclei complement current histology-based atlases. We further created a companion library of software tools for atlas development, to offer an open and evolving resource for the creation of a crowd-sourced in vivo probabilistic anatomical atlas of the human brain.},

   abstract = {The functional organization of the cerebellum is reflected in large part by the unique afferent and efferent connectivity of the individual cerebellar lobules. This functional diversity on a relatively small spatial scale makes accurate localization methods for human functional imaging and anatomical patient-based research indispensable. Here we present a probabilistic atlas of the cerebellar lobules in the anatomical space defined by the MNI152 template. We separately masked the lobules on T1-weighted MRI scans (1 mm isotropic resolution) of 20 healthy young participants (10 male, 10 female, average age 23.7 yrs). These cerebella were then aligned to the standard or non-linear version of the whole-brain MNI152 template using a number of commonly used normalization algorithms, or to a previously published cerebellum-only template (Diedrichsen, J., 2006. A spatially unbiased atlas template of the human cerebellum. NeuroImage 33, 127-138.). The resulting average overlap was higher for the cerebellum-only template than for any of the whole-brain normalization methods. The probabilistic maps allow for the valid assignment of functional activations to specific cerebellar lobules, while providing a quantitative measure of the uncertainty of such assignments. Furthermore, maximum probability maps derived from these atlases can be used to define regions of interest (ROIs) in functional neuroimaging and neuroanatomical research. The atlas, made freely available online, is compatible with a number of widely used analysis packages. © 2008.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we present a groupwise graph-theory-based parcellation approach to define nodes for network analysis. The application of network-theory-based analysis to extend the utility of functional MRI has recently received increased attention. Such analyses require first and foremost a reasonable definition of a set of nodes as input to the network analysis. To date many applications have used existing atlases based on cytoarchitecture, task-based fMRI activations, or anatomic delineations. A potential pitfall in using such atlases is that the mean timecourse of a node may not represent any of the constituent timecourses if different functional areas are included within a single node. The proposed approach involves a groupwise optimization that ensures functional homogeneity within each subunit and that these definitions are consistent at the group level. Parcellation reproducibility of each subunit is computed across multiple groups of healthy volunteers and is demonstrated to be high. Issues related to the selection of appropriate number of nodes in the brain are considered. Within typical parameters of fMRI resolution, parcellation results are shown for a total of 100, 200, and 300 subunits. Such parcellations may ultimately serve as a functional atlas for fMRI and as such three atlases at the 100-, 200- and 300-parcellation levels derived from 79 healthy normal volunteers are made freely available online along with tools to interface this atlas with SPM, BioImage Suite and other analysis packages. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Software developed to automatically identify sulco-gyral structures has improved substantially as a result of techniques providing topologically correct reconstructions permitting inflated views of the human brain. Here we describe a complete parcellation of the cortical surface using standard internationally accepted nomenclature and criteria. This parcellation is available in the FreeSurfer package. First, a computer-assisted hand parcellation classified each vertex as sulcal or gyral, and these were then subparcellated into 74 labels per hemisphere. Twelve datasets were used to develop rules and algorithms (reported here) that produced labels consistent with anatomical rules as well as automated computational parcellation. The final parcellation was used to build an atlas for automatically labeling the whole cerebral cortex. This atlas was used to label an additional 12 datasets, which were found to have good concordance with manual labels. This paper presents a precisely defined method for automatically labeling the cortical surface in standard terminology.}

Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.}

ABSTRACT={<p>We introduce the Mindboggle-101 dataset, the largest and most complete set of free, publicly accessible, manually labeled human brain images. To manually label the macroscopic anatomy in magnetic resonance images of 101 healthy participants, we created a new cortical labeling protocol that relies on robust anatomical landmarks and minimal manual edits after initialization with automated labels. The “Desikan–Killiany–Tourville” (DKT) protocol is intended to improve the ease, consistency, and accuracy of labeling human cortical areas. Given how difficult it is to label brains, the Mindboggle-101 dataset is intended to serve as brain atlases for use in labeling other brains, as a normative dataset to establish morphometric variation in a healthy population for comparison against clinical populations, and contribute to the development, training, testing, and evaluation of automated registration and labeling algorithms. To this end, we also introduce benchmarks for the evaluation of such algorithms by comparing our manual labels with labels automatically generated by probabilistic and multi-atlas registration-based approaches.

abstract = {We present a technique for automatically assigning a neuroanatomical label to each voxel in an MRI volume based on probabilistic information automatically estimated from a manually labeled training set. In contrast to existing segmentation procedures that only label a small number of tissue classes, the current method assigns one of 37 labels to each voxel, including left and right caudate, putamen, pallidum, thalamus, lateral ventricles, hippocampus, and amygdala. The classification technique employs a registration procedure that is robust to anatomical variability, including the ventricular enlargement typically associated with neurological diseases and aging. The technique is shown to be comparable in accuracy to manual labeling, and of sufficient sensitivity to robustly detect changes in the volume of noncortical structures that presage the onset of probable Alzheimer's disease.}

  abstract = "PURPOSE: With the advent of noninvasive neuroimaging, a plethora
              of digital human neuroanatomical atlases has been developed. The
              accuracy of these atlases is constrained by the resolution and
              signal-gathering powers of available imaging equipment. In an
              attempt to circumvent these limitations and to produce a high
              resolution in vivo human neuroanatomy, we investigated the
              usefulness of intrasubject registration for post hoc MR signal
              averaging. METHOD: Twenty-seven high resolution (7 x 0.78 and 20
              x 1.0 mm3) T1-weighted volumes were acquired from a single
              subject, along with 12 double echo T2/proton density-weighted
              volumes. These volumes were automatically registered to a common
              stereotaxic space in which they were subsampled and intensity
              averaged. The resulting images were examined for anatomical
              quality and usefulness for other analytical techniques. RESULTS:
              The quality of the resulting image from the combination of as few
              as five T1 volumes was visibly enhanced. The signal-to-noise
              ratio was expected to increase as the root of the number of
              contributing scans to 5.2, n = 27. The improvement in the n = 27
              average was great enough that fine anatomical details, such as
              thalamic subnuclei and the gray bridges between the caudate and
              putamen, became crisply defined. The gray/white matter boundaries
              were also enhanced, as was the visibility of any finer structure
              that was surrounded by tissue of varying T1 intensity. The T2 and
              proton density average images were also of higher quality than
              single scans, but the improvement was not as dramatic as that of
              the T1 volumes. CONCLUSION: Overall, the enhanced signal in the
              averaged images resulted in higher quality anatomical images, and
              the data lent themselves to several postprocessing techniques.
              The high quality of the enhanced images permits novel uses of the
              data and extends the possibilities for in vivo human

   abstract = {The results of most neuroimaging studies are reported in volumetric (e.g., MNI152) or surface (e.g., fsaverage) coordinate systems. Accurate mappings between volumetric and surface coordinate systems can facilitate many applications, such as projecting fMRI group analyses from MNI152/Colin27 to fsaverage for visualization or projecting resting-state fMRI parcellations from fsaverage to MNI152/Colin27 for volumetric analysis of new data. However, there has been surprisingly little research on this topic. Here, we evaluated three approaches for mapping data between MNI152/Colin27 and fsaverage coordinate systems by simulating the above applications: projection of group-average data from MNI152/Colin27 to fsaverage and projection of fsaverage parcellations to MNI152/Colin27. Two of the approaches are currently widely used. A third approach (registration fusion) was previously proposed, but not widely adopted. Two implementations of the registration fusion (RF) approach were considered, with one implementation utilizing the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs). We found that RF-ANTs performed the best for mapping between fsaverage and MNI152/Colin27, even for new subjects registered to MNI152/Colin27 using a different software tool (FSL FNIRT). This suggests that RF-ANTs would be useful even for researchers not using ANTs. Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the most optimal approach for mapping data to a coordinate system (e.g., fsaverage) is to register individual subjects directly to the coordinate system, rather than via another coordinate system. Only in scenarios where the optimal approach is not possible (e.g., mapping previously published results from MNI152 to fsaverage), should the approaches evaluated in this manuscript be considered. In these scenarios, we recommend RF-ANTs (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/registration/Wu2017_RegistrationFusion).},

   abstract = {Most human brain-imaging studies have traditionally used low-resolution images, inaccurate methods of cross-subject alignment, and extensive blurring. Recently, a high-resolution approach with more accurate alignment and minimized blurring was used by the Human Connectome Project to generate a multimodal map of human cortical areas in hundreds of individuals. Starting from these data, we systematically compared these two approaches, showing that the traditional approach is nearly three times worse than the Human Connectome Project’s improved approach in two objective measures of spatial localization of cortical areas. Furthermore, we demonstrate considerable challenges in comparing data across the two approaches and, as a result, argue that there is an urgent need for the field to adopt more accurate methods of data acquisition and analysis.},

    abstract = { Distinct regions of the cerebellum connect to separate regions of the cerebral cortex forming a complex topography. Although cerebellar organization has been examined in group-averaged data, study of individuals provides an opportunity to discover features that emerge at a higher spatial resolution. Here, functional connectivity MRI was used to examine the cerebellum of two intensively sampled individuals (each scanned 31 times). Connectivity to somatomotor cortex showed the expected crossed laterality and topography of the body maps. A surprising discovery was connectivity to the primary visual cortex along the vermis with evidence for representation of the central field. Within the hemispheres, each individual displayed a hierarchical progression from the inverted anterior lobe somatomotor map through to higher-order association zones. The hierarchy ended at Crus I/II and then progressed in reverse order through to the upright somatomotor map in the posterior lobe. Evidence for a third set of networks was found in the most posterior extent of the cerebellum. Detailed analysis of the higher-order association networks revealed robust representations of two distinct networks linked to the default network, multiple networks linked to cognitive control, as well as a separate representation of a language network. Although idiosyncratic spatial details emerged between subjects, each network could be detected in both individuals, and seed regions placed within the cerebellum recapitulated the full extent of the spatially specific cerebral networks. The observation of multiple networks in juxtaposed regions at the Crus I/II apex confirms the importance of this zone to higher-order cognitive function and reveals new organizational details.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Stable, within-individual maps of cerebellar organization reveal orderly macroscale representations of the cerebral cortex with local juxtaposed zones representing distinct networks. In addition, individuals reveal idiosyncratic organizational features. }

   abstract = {Single-and double-label immunohistochemical techniques using several different highly specific antisera against dynorphin peptides were used to examine the distribution of dynorphinergic terminals in globus pallidus and substantia nigra in rhesus monkeys and humans in comparison to substance P-containing and enkephalinergic terminals in these same regions. Similar results were observed in monkey and human tissue. Dynorphinergic fibers were very abundant in the medial half of the internal pallidal segment, but scarce in the external pallidal segment and the lateral half of the internal pallidal segment. In substantia nigra, dynorphinergic fibers were present in both the pars compacta and reticulata. Labeling of adjacent sections for enkephalin or substance P showed that the dynorphinergic terminals overlapped those for substance P in the medial half of the internal pallidal segment, but showed only slight overlap with enkephalinergic terminals in the external pallidal segment. The substance P-containing fibers were moderately abundant along the borders of the external pallidal segment, and enkephalinergic fibers were moderately abundant in parts of the internal pallidal segment. Dynorphinergic and substance P-containing terminals overlapped extensively in the nigra, and both extensively overlapped enkephalin-ergic fibers in medial nigra. Immunofluorescence double-labeling studies revealed that dynorphin co-localized extensively with substance P in individual fibers and terminals in the medial half of the internal pallidal segment and in substantia nigra. Thus, as has been found in non-primates, dynorphin within the striatum and its projection systems appears to be extensively localized to substance P-containing striatopallidal and striatonigral projection neurons. Nonetheless, our results also raise the possibility that a population of substance P-containing neurons that projects to the internal pallidal segment and does not contain dynorphin is present in primate striatum. Our results also suggest the possible existence of populations of striatopallidal and striatonigral projection neurons in which substance P and enkephalin or dynorphin and enkephalin, or all three, are co-localized. Thus, striatal projection neurons in primates may not consist of merely two types, one containing substance P and dynorphin and the other enkephalin. 1998 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. Several neuropeptides are abundant in large numbers of striatal projection neurons of the basal ganglia. These peptides include the preprotachykinin-derived neuropeptides substance P (SP) and neurokinin A (also known as substance K) and diverse proenkephalin-derived peptides such as leucine-and methionine-enkephalin. 5,6,14,18,26,40-42,44,47,62,65, 84,85,91 Single-and double-label immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies have been taken to support the conclusion that while preprotachykinin-derived neuropeptides (i.e. SP and neurokinin A) co-localize in a subpopulation of striatal neurons, proenkephalin-derived peptides (ENK) are typically found in a separate population of striatal neurons. 5,35,39,91 Consistent with this interpretation, SP+ and ENK+ fibers have largely different distributions in both globus pallidus and substantia nigra in rats and cats. Substance P-containing fibers are abundant in both the entopeduncular nucleus (EP) (the rodent/feline homologue of the primate internal ‡To whom correspondence should be addressed.},

The comparative distribution of these fibers are described in the human globus pallidus and basal forebrain area. The results show two main points: (1) The human globus pallidus is a larger, more intricately shaped structure than previously thought, invading several limbic-related basal forebrain regions. (2) There are differences in the distribution patterns of the neuropeptides described, so that they are found in overlapping, but not matching regions. The relationship between the peptide distribution and what is known about the functional (limbic vs motor) circuitry of the region is discussed.},

   abstract = {Outcome-specific Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT) demonstrates the way that reward-related cues influence choice between instrumental actions. The nucleus accumbens shell (NAc-S) contributes critically to this effect, particularly through its output to the rostral medial ventral pallidum (VP-m). Using rats, we investigated in two experiments the role in the PIT effect of the two major outputs of this VP-m region innervated by the NAc-S, the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA). First, two retrograde tracers were injected into the MD and VTA to compare the neuronal activity of the two populations of projection neurons in the VP-m during PIT relative to controls. Second, the functional role of the connection between the VP-m and the MD or VTA was assessed using asymmetrical pharmacological manipulations before a PIT test. It was found that, whereas neurons in the VP-m projecting to the MD showed significantly more neuronal activation during PIT than those projecting to the VTA, neuronal activation of these latter neurons correlated with the size of the PIT effect. Disconnection of the two pathways during PIT also revealed different deficits in performance: disrupting the VP-m to MD pathway removed the response biasing effects of reward-related cues, whereas disrupting the VP-m to VTA pathway preserved the response bias but altered the overall rate of responding. The current results therefore suggest that the VP-m exerts distinct effects on the VTA and MD and that these latter structures mediate the motivational and cognitive components of specific PIT, respectively.},
