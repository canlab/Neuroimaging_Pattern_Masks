PainGen Participants:

Participants were recruited by telephone from the Colorado Community Twin Sample, which is
derived from the Colorado Twin Registry, a population-based registry which has been run by the
Institute of Behavioral Genetics (IBG) at the University of Colorado since 1984. The study
includes a larger sample of participants, but the data here are from a subset of 248 unrelated 
participants. Subjects from the same families, or subjects with image quality metrics greater
than 3SD away form the mean were excluded. MRIQC 0.16.1 was was used to compute image quality
metrics. Participants were excluded from participation in the study if they did not pass MRI 
screening (e.g., add metals in their body) or had a history of liver disease/damage, allergies 
to local analgesics, or were breastfeeding.

In the full dataset (including siblings and participants with bad image quality metrics) 
Participants’ age ranged from approximately 30 to 43 years (M = 35, SD = 2.6), and the sample 
included approximately 100 men and 140 women. All participants provided their informed consent 
at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment was approved by the institutional review board 
of the University of Colorado Boulder. 


PainGen Imaging data acquisition:

Imaging data were acquired using a 3T Siemens Prisma MRI scanner with a 32-channels head
coil, at the University of Colorado at Boulder. First, a T1-weighted structural scan was acquired
using a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) pulse sequence with parallel
imaging factor (iPAT) of 3, TR=2000 ms, TE=2.11ms, flip angle=8 degrees, FOV=256mm,
resolution=0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8mm. Additional functional and structural scans were collected but are not
relevant to this dataset.


BMRK5 participants:

Participants. Participants are part of a larger sample of 97 individuals 
(47 male, age 19–54 years; M = 28.98, s.d. = 5.56) 33 AA individuals (15 male), 
32 non-Hispanic WA individuals (16 male) and 32 HA individuals (16 males), based 
on self-reported ethnicity. 89 had data available for this analysis.

Participants were recruited from the greater Denver area through Craigslist or
one of three different participant pools from the University of Colorado Boulder
Institute for Behavioral Genetics (IBG) to capitalize on existing genetic data on
these participants in future analyses. Participants reported no current or recent
(past 6 months) neurological or psychiatric diagnosis and reported no current use
of psychoactive or pain medications. Participants also reported no pain-related
medical conditions.

The study was approved by the University of Colorado Boulder Institutional Review Board 
and we complied with all relevant ethical regulations when carrying out the study. Written 
informed consent was obtained from all participants, who were financially compensated 
for their participation.


BMRK5 Data acquisition. 

Data were collected on a 3 Tesla Siemens Trio MRI scanner at the University of 
Colorado Boulder Center for Innovation and Creativity. A high-resolution T1-weighted 
magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) structural scan (1x1x1 mm3 voxels,
repetition time (TR): 2,530 ms, echo time (TE): 1.64 ms, flip angle: 7*, inversion
time (Tl): 1,200 ms, field of view (FoV) read: 256 mm, echo spacing: 12.2 ms,
bandwidth: 651 Hz Px-1, time: 6:03) was performed on each participant.


Anatomical data preprocessing (identical for PainGen and BMRK5): 

The T1-weighted (T1w) image was corrected for intensity nonuniformity (INU) with N4BiasFieldCorrection, 
distributed with ANTs 2.3.3 (RRID:SCR_004757), and used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow. The 
T1w-reference was then skullstripped with a Nipype implementation of the antsBrainExtraction.sh workflow 
(from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs as target template. Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 
whitematter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on the brain-extracted T1w using fast (FSL 5.0.9, 
RRID:SCR_002823). Brain surfaces were reconstructed using recon-all (FreeSurfer 6.0.1, RRID:SCR_001847), 
and the brain mask estimated previously was refined with a custom variation of the method to reconcile 
ANTs-derived and FreeSurfer-derived segmentations of the cortical gray-matter of Mindboggle 
(RRID:SCR_002438). Volume-based spatial normalization to two standard spaces (MNI152NLin2009cAsym, 
MNI152NLin6Asym) was performed through nonlinear registration with antsRegistration (ANTs 2.3.3), using 
brain extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template. The following templates were selected 
for spatial normalization: ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c (RRID:SCR_008796; 
TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin2009cAsym], FSL's MNI ICBM 152 nonlinear 6th Generation Asymmetric Average 
Brain Stereotaxic Registration Model (RRID:SCR_002823; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin6Asym).


Data analysis:

Registration fusion was performed using the approach detailed by Wu, Ngo, Greve, et al. (2018) Human
Brain Mapping, except that all transformations used were computed by fmriprep as detailed above. 
Registration fusion was implemented on an HPC system with one job instance per participant. An example
script is included with this data release. See single_subject_registration_fusion.sh for comprehensive
methods. Briefly, data was resampled from a freesurfer 164k sphere, obtained from,
https://github.com/Washington-University/HCPpipelines/blob/master/global/templates/standard_mesh_atlases/fs_R/fs_L-to-fs_LR_fsaverage.L_LR.spherical_std.164k_fs_L.surf.gii
https://github.com/Washington-University/HCPpipelines/blob/master/global/templates/standard_mesh_atlases/fs_R/fs_R-to-fs_LR_fsaverage.R_LR.spherical_std.164k_fs_R.surf.gii
onto the subject specific registered spherical surface ([lr]h.sphere.reg in the freesurfer output 
directory). This was then projected into subject native space using and then transformed from native
space intor MNI152NLin2009cAsym and MNI152NLin6Asym spaces. The results for the left and right hemisphere
were combined into a single image and concatenated across subjects for each space and study.
